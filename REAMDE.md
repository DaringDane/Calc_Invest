# Investment Portfolio Calculator
_Purpose_: This python package is intended to create a life snapshot of an individual and return projections of their 
investment portfolio up till and beyond retirement (of their choice) and implement my personal model for distributing
investment funds, dividends, and personal spending funds that could provide someone working in a corporate environment
a roadmap to retiring comfortably. 

## Anticipated Functionalities
1. Take a table of expenses with names, frequency of purchase, and whether or not payments have interest
associated, and generate monthly impact totals against their income
2. Have users input their __before tax salary__ and __tax filing status__, __amount of current investments__, 
__average expected % yield via dividends__ from all investments (very rough estimate), and __amount of dividends to reinvest
vs. apply to their discretionary income__. Calculations of after tax income and dividend reinvestment calculations take 
place, factoring in expense totals to yield _visualizations of projected investment/discretionary spending totals_ up to 
90 years of age with their _potential minimum retirement year highlighted_.

3. Users should be able to submit their **current income**, **filing status**, **desired retirement age** and 
**minimum personal spending totals**, including necessary living expenses and discretionary spending, and _RETURN_ whether
this outcome is possible with their current situation, and if it is, what the minimum necessary amount of investment is
to maximize the money they could spend on themselves in attaining proper retirement savings.

## __Limitations__
* Relies on relatively accurate accounting of expenses by the user. 
* Accounts for average wage increasesand inflation averages, but will initially assume maintained payment at the rate specified. 
* Assumes a relatively stable economy - doesn't account for recessions, but an average over longer periods of time
